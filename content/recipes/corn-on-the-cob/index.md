### Corn on the Cob

Everyone seems to have their own perfect way of cooking corn on the cob. Mine is pretty simple and turns out well cooked and well textured corn. 

### Ingredients

* Fresh corn on the cob

### Steps

1. Shuck the corn and clean off all the silk strands.
2. Put the corn in a pot.
3. Cover the corn with water (the corn will float) and then add an extra 1/4 to 1/2 inch of water on top.
4. Put a lid on the pot.
5. Put the pot on medium-high heat and let it heat up until the water reaches a roiling boil.
6. Turn off the heat and let the corn sit 6-8 minutes covered.

### Bonus

My family has long buttered our fresh, hot corn on the cob the same way. Take a piece of bread (old, staler bread works great here) and liberally butter one side of the bread. In one hand, fold the bread into a U-shape. Place the hot corn in the bread. Twist and move the corn back and forth until fully buttered. Apply more butter to the bread as needed. Reuse the bread until it falls apart.
