# Fluff Salads

Fluff salads have existed in the Midwest for years and years. I've had some pretty good ones and some pretty bad ones. I've always liked the texture of my grandma's and I'm sharing that here. Frozen fruit is essential for this as you want the softer texture versus fresh fruit. Feel free to mix flavours however you want. I like to keep strawberr (gelatin) with strawberries or raspberry (gelatin) with raspberries but anything works.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb of frozen fruit, thawed (frozen strawberries, raspberries, etc.)
* 1 3-4 oz package of flavoured gelatin (I use dye free gelatin but regular Jell-O or other brands work fine)
* 1 8oz container of Cool Whip (this is one of the few times I do recommend a brand, other brands will work but don't come out as smooth)


### Steps

1. Heat up water and mix in the gelatin according to the instructions for your particular brand.
2. Put the gelatin mix in the fridge to cool. You want it to cool for at least an hour and start to firm up. You do *not* want it to set fully.
3. Put the cool whip into a large bowl.
4. Pull out the partially set gelatin and pour it into the cool whip.
5. Stir the two together until mixed well.
6. Add your fruit and stir until fully mixed.
7. Put back in the fridge until it is fully set, for a few hours or overnight .
