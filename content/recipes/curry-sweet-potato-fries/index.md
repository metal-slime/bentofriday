# Curry Sweet Potato Fries

Who doesn't like a good sweet potato fry? This is one of the few things Bob Belcher and I disagree on. I love them. Eat these as is or use a favourite dipping sauce.

### Ingredients

* Raw sweet potato, washed and scrubbed clean. Peel is optional (I leave it on)
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Curry powder (sweet, hot, or Japanese, your choice)
* Onion powder
* Salt


### Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 450 F (I like to use a little convection oven with burners on both the top and bottom)
2. Slice your sweet potatoes to desired lengh. Then cut sweet potato in half, and then into quarters.
3. Slice wedges out of the quarters (be careful not to cut yourself).
4. Put the wedges in a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Toss in the olive oil to evenly distribute it.
5. Line a baking pan or sheet with aluminum foil.
6. Put the wedges flat across the pan, making sure they do not touch.
7. Dust the wedges with curry and onion powder.
#### Dual heat source ovens
8. If using a smaller convection oven with dual burners, put the pan next to the top burner and cook for 8-10 minutes. You want them to start to brown but not burn.
9. Move the fries down to the middle of your oven and let cook for another 15-20 minutes. Keeping an eye on them so they don't burn.
#### Regular oven
8. If using a regular oven, cook on a middle rack for 20 minutes.
9. Remove the fries from the oven, flip each one over. Put back in for 5 minutes.
10. Put fries under boiler (if available) for a few minutes, so they brown but don't let them burn.
#### Post oven
11. Let fries cool for a minute or two.
12. Put fries in a clean bowl, add salt and toss to combine.
13. Eat the fries.
