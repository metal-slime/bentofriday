# Honey Mustard Broccoli

All you need is come cooking oil, a frying pan with a lid, frozen broccoli florets, mustard (I use yellow), and some honey.

### Ingredients

* 1-2 tbsp of your preferred cooking oil (I prefer ghee, lard, or beef tallow for this)
* 14-16 oz of frozen broccoli florets
* Mustard to taste
* Honey to taste
* (Optional) BBQ sauce to broaden the flavour


### Steps

1. Heat up your oil of choice in the pan at medium heat.
2. Add in the broccoli and cover. It is important the broccoli is still frozen as this makes the steam that helps cook the broccoli.
3. Let it steam for 4-10 minutes. Take the lid off, give it a stir.
4. Add in the mustard, honey, and BBQ sauce if using.
5. Stir the broccoli in the sauce until it is absorb.
6. Taste the broccoli. Add more mustard/honey/bbq as desired.
