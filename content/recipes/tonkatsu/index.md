# Tonkatsu

Fried pork bliss. Simple. Delicious.

### Ingredients

* 4oz - 8oz pork chop (I prefer rib cut chops)
* Flour
* Beaten eggs
* Panko

### Steps

1. Using a deep frier or dutch oven, pre-heat enough frying oil to submerge your pork chop in to 350 F.
2. Wrap the pork chop in plastic wrap or butcher's paper. Beat (with a meat mallet, rolling pin, etc) until it is between a quarter and a half inch thick. If desired, salt and pepper the pork for seasoning. It isn't necessary but can add some flavour.
2. Put your flour, beaten egg, and panko into three separate dishes.
3. Gently put the pork in the flour and coat with the flour, making sure to cover both flat sides and the ends. Shake off any excess flour.
4. Still being gentle, dip the flour covered chop in the egg until it is coated. (Can repeat the flour egg combination another time if desired)
5. Put the egg covered chop on to the panko. Put some panko on top of the chop. Press firmly into the panko. Flip and repeat.
6. Gently lower the pork chop into the oil. Let cook for 1.5-2 minutes and then flip. Cook for another 1.5-2 minutes. Total cooking time should be 3-4 minutes but no longer.
7. Remove tonkatsu from oil and place on a paper towel coverd rack to let the oil dry out.

Can be served hot or cold, your choice.
