# Hawaiian Sliders

Ham loaf shaped into balls, and smashed into burgers. Served on hawaiian rolls.

### Ingredients

* Ham Loaf divided into 2oz portions
* Hawaiian Rolls
* White cheese of choice (Muenster, White American, White Cheddar, Provolone, etc)
* Pineapple slices
* Mayo


### Steps

1. Take your ham loaf and divide it into 2oz portions. IF you don't have ham loaf, you can grind up ham and pork (or use pre-ground pork) in a 50-50 mixture.
2. Heat up a skillet on medium-low to medium heat.
3. Smash a ball down to desired size in pan. Repeat until your pan is full.
4. Let a good crust form and then flip the sliders. You only want to flip these once as they cook fast.
5. Put your cheese on and let it melt. Remove from heat.
6. Heat up another skillet on medium to medim-high heat. (it can be the same skillet as before or you can use another and do this at the same time)
7. Put the pineapple slices down flat on the skillet. Let cook a few minutes until they brown. Remove from heat.
8. Slice pineapple slices into slices appropriate for your sliders size.
9. Slice your hawaiian rolls in half.
10. Put mayo on the top bun.
11. Put a slider on the bottom bun. Top it with pineapple and then the top bun.

Enjoy!
