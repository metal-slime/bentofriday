# Smoked Pulled Pork

I love pork. Smoking a nice, bone-in pork butt or shoulder (same cut, different name), is easy and straightforward with very little prep. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

### Ingredients

* 8-14 lb bone-in pork butt/shoulder
* Kosher Salt
* (Memphis Magic Dust)[https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/meatheads-memphis-dust-rub-recipe/]


### Steps

1. The night before you smoke your pork butt, remove it from any packaging, pat it dry, and sprinkle it with kosher salt from about a foot above the pork. Let it dry brine overnight in your refrigerator.
2. Pre-heat your smoker to 225-230 F.
3. The next morning, liberally coat and lightly pat in the magic dust on every side and end of the pork.
4. Make sure you have water in your water pan in your smoker and put the pork butt in. I insert a meat thermometer into the pork butt before butting it in. Mine is corded but wireless should work as well.
5. Add your wood chips and start smoking. My electric smoker has a chimney attachment I can use that stores woodchips that are a good 2-4 hours worth of smoke. Refill your wood chips as you need to.
6. Check the temp routinely, if I get a stall, I turn the heat up 5 degrees. I usually don't cover unless it is an unusually long stall.
7. Continue smoking until the pork reads 195-205 F.
8. Pull the pork butt and let it sit in a pan for about 5 minutes.
9. Shred the pork. The bone should slide right out nice and easy and the pork should be very easy to shred.
10. I usually toss the pork in a little carolina vinegar sauce before serving or storing.

Serve with your favourite sauce or toppings. It goes well with just about everything, including coleslaw.

Enjoy!
