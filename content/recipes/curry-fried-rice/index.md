# Curry Fried Rice

If a chronological reader can't tell by now, I like curry. This is the base for what I use when I make curry fried rice. Proteins and ingredients are mostly optional and can be subbed however you would like.

### Ingredients

* Jasmine rice
* Neutral cooking oil (I use canola)
* Curry powder (sweet, hot, or Japanese, your choice)
* Diced garlic
* Fish Sauce
* Eggs (I usually use 1 egg per cup of uncooked rice + 1 extra egg, ie 3 cups of rice would be 4 eggs)
* MSG
* Butter
* Protein, cut into bite size pieces or smaller
* Frozen vegetables (optional)
* Pineapple (optional)
* Thai chilis (diced, optional)


### Steps

1. Cook your rice. Some people say cook it and let it sit overnight. I've used fresh and old. I've not found much of a difference.
2. Heat up some oil in your wok or frying pan.
3. Add your eggs and scramble quickly. You want to cook about 60% of the way through. Put in a container.
4. Clean the egg out of the pan with paper towel, try not to burn yourself.
5. Add more oil. Add about a half tablespoon to a tablespoon of curry powder and let it cook just a little bit. If you're using thai chilis, add about a third into the oil now.
6. Add your protein and cook until done.
7. Empty the protein into another bowl and set aside.
8. Add more oil. Add about another half tablespoon to tablespoon of curry, depending on how much rice you have. If you're using thai chilis, add the rest of the thai chilis to the oil now.
9. Add your diced garlic and let it cook about 15-30 seconds.
10. Add in your fish sauce, stir, and then add your vegetables and stir fry them until cooked.
11. Add your rice, a little at a time, and fry.
12. Add your protein back in and stir to mix.
13. Add your egg in and stir to mix.
14. Add in your MSG and stir to mix.
15. Remove from heat and add your butter to the top. Let the butter melt and then mix it all up.

Enjoy!
