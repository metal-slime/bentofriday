# Spaghetti Casserole

Pasta baked with sausage, sauce, and cheese on top. I don't know where my mom stumbled upon this recipe but I've been making it ever since, tweaking it until I got to this version.

### Ingredients

* 16oz - 24oz ground italian sausage (hot or sweet, your choice)
* 16 oz of thick spaghetti, bucatini, fettuccine (or other thick tubular pasta)
* 1 stick of salted butter (whole, halved, or cubed)
* 2 - 3 large eggs
* 8 oz shredded sharp cheddar
* 8 oz shredded mozzarella
* Grated Parmesan (optional)
* 24 oz of pasta sauce, jarred or homemade

### Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 350 - 375 F.
2. Brown your sausage in a pain, breaking it up into medium small chunks.
3. Bring water to a boil and cook pasta according to directions, want it on the firmer side of the directions.
4. Quickly drain pasta and put into a large mixing bowl, you still want it hot.
5. Put the butter into the hot pasta and stir it until it is melted and evenly spread on the pasta.
6. Crack your eggs and put them directly into the pasta. Stir until evenly spread.
7. Pour half the cheddar into the pasta. Stir it all up. Add the rest. Stir to mix.
8. Grease a 9x13 baking dish and put the pasta into it. Spread it out to form a smooth layer.
9. If using parmesan, dust the top of the pasta with it.
10. Spread the sausage across the top of the pasta.
11. Spread your sauce across the top of the sausage.
12. Spread the mozzarella across the top of the sauce.
13. Bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes. You want the cheese to melt and start to brown but not over brown.

Let cool for a few minutes, then cut and serve.
