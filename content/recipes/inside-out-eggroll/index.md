# Inside Out Eggroll Salad

There are many names for this, eggroll in a bowl, inside out eggroll, etc etc. I'm calling this an inside out eggroll salad because, for this bento, I served it as a salad. My recipe was inspired by the one found at [Natasha's Kitchen](https://natashaskitchen.com/egg-roll-in-a-bowl-recipe/).

### Ingredients

* 20-22 oz of coleslaw salad mix (pre-shredded cabbage, red cabbage, carrots)
* 1 lb of ground chicken, turkey, or pork
* 1 small vidalia onion, diced (I use my handy dandy onion chopper to save my eyes)
* 1-2 tbsp ev olive oil (normal will work)
* 3-4 cloves of garlic, diced
* 1/4 cup of usukuchi (light coloured) soy sauce (normal soy sauce will work)
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1.5 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp sugar
* salt and pepper to season


### Steps

1. Heat the olive oil in a larger pan over medium heat. Once the oil is heated, add the diced onion. Cook the onion until it softens, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Add salt and pepper to taste.
3. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes.
4. Add the coleslaw mix to the pan. Let it begin to cook down, about 5 minutes, stirring a few times.
5. Add the ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and the sugar. Stir until well mixed. Cook for another 5-10 minutes until desired firmness/doneness of the vegetables.
