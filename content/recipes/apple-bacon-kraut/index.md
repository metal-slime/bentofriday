# Apple Bacon Sauerkraut

Do you like sauerkraut? Do you ever wish it could somehow be more awesome? Try this.

### Ingredients

* 1/4-1/2 pounds sliced apple-wood smoked bacon
* 2 tart apples, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and grated (if you donâ€™t have a grater, you can finely dice the apples)
* 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds, ground (optional)
* 3 cups unfiltered apple cider or juice
* 1/4 cup white, apple cider, or white whine vinegar
* 2 pounds refrigerated sauerkraut, drained (do not use canned sauerkraut)

### Steps

1. Slice uncooked bacon into bite size pieces. Put the bacon into a pot. Cook until the bacon has browned and most of the bacon fat has been rendered.
2. Remove the bacon from the pot and set on paper towels to drain. Remove all but 1 Tbsp of the fat in the pot. Set aside.
3. Add the chopped onions and apples to the pot and cook until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and caraway (if using) and cook for about a minute more.
4. Add the apple juice and the vinegar to the pot. Increase the heat to high. Bring to a boil and boil vigorously until the liquid is reduced to a syrup. This can take anywhere from 10 to about 40 minutes, keep an eye on it.
5. Add the sauerkraut and bacon to the pot and stir to coat with the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauerkraut has been heated through and is tender, about 5-10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Can be served hot or cold, your choice.
