# Summer Corn and Avocado Salad

The wife asked for a summer-y salad so I went looking on the internet as I do. I saw a lot of similar ingredients over and over and thought, I can do that. This is the result. A lighter salad with summer fruits and flavours. You'll notice the amounts of the veggies and fruit aren't specified. Adjust it as you see fit for your own balance.

### Ingredients

* Baby spinach - washed
* Romaine lettuce (optional) - washed
* Avocado
* Strawberries - washed
* Fresh corn on the cob
* Lemon juice
* Extra virgin olive oil - at least 1 tbps and more per your preference


### Steps

1. [Cook]({{< relref "recipes/corn-on-the-cob" >}}) the corn and then slice off the kernels with a sharp knife.
2. Cut the strawberries into halves or whatever is appropriate for how big your berries are. The bigger the berry, the more sections.
3. Cut or tear the lettuce into bite size pieces if using.
4. Toss the spinach with the lettuce, strawberries, and corn.
5. Before serving or plating, halve your avocados and remove the pit. Cut the avocado into chunks.
6. Toss the avocado with between 1/2 and 1 tablespoon per avocado.
7. Add however much olive oil you're using to the avocado lemon juice mix and toss around to mix.
8. Pour the avocado/lemon juice/oil mixture into the rest of the salad. Mix/toss and serve.
