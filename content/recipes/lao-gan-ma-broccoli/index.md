# Lao Gan Ma Broccoli

All you need is come cooking oil, a frying pan with a lid, frozen broccoli florets, and some lao gan ma to make a wonderfully flavourful and slightly spicy side.

### Ingredients

* 1-2 tbsp of your preferred cooking oil (I prefer ghee, lard, or beef tallow for this)
* 14-16 oz of frozen broccoli florets
* lao gan ma
* salt and pepper to season


### Steps

1. Heat up your oil of choice in the pan at medium heat.
2. Add in the broccoli and cover. It is important the broccoli is still frozen as this makes the steam that helps cook the broccoli.
3. Let it steam for 4-10 minutes. Take the lid off, give it a stir.
4. Add in the lao gan ma and stir it all up.
5. Let the broccoli cook for a few minutes on each side, you want to get a little browning or char.
