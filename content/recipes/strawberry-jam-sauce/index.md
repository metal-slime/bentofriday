# Strawberry Jam Sauce

What exactly is strawberry jam sauce? Well, it is cooked down similar to a jam, but it is still a topping like a sauce. I couldn't think of a better name, sue me.

### Ingredients

* 1-2 pounds of strawberries with the tops removed and sliced in half
* Sugar to taste
* Lemon juice to taste

### Steps

1. Wash and remove the tops of the strawberries, don't want any of that green in this. Slice the berries in half and put in a pot.
2. Add 1/4 of a cup to 1/2 of a cup of sugar depending on amount of strawberries and how sweet you want it. I try to use less sugar.
3. Add about a half a lemon (fresh) or a squeeze or two from bottled lemon juice. You want it a bit tart to really bring out the sweet but you don't want anyone to pucker.
4. Heat over medium heat.
5. As the strawberries heat up, you're going to want to mash them. Take out a potato masher and mash them down a bit. You still want chunks but not big chunks. Repeat this until your desired consistency is reached. I mash 2-4 times total.
6. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat a little bit. Stirring frequently.
7. Once your desired consistency is reached, remove from heat and transfer to another bowl or container. Put this other container in the fridge or an ice bath to cool.
