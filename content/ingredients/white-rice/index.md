# Japanese Style White Rice

Anytime I need Japanese style rice for a bento, I reach for my bag of Nishiki medium grain rice. It works for me for everything from donburi to onigiri. I usually get it in 15 lb bags from Amazon. If you don't have Nishiki, any calrose will work. Otherwise, medium grain white rice can be subsituted. It may not be as sticky, though.
