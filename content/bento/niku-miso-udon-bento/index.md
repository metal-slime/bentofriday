# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is my Gretchen’s favourite main dish, niku miso udon. This comes with a side of inside out egg roll salad, blueberry, raspberry, and banana fruit salad, and pickles. いただきます。

### Niku Miso
The niku miso is made using the recipe for [Niku Miso](https://www.justonecookbook.com/miso-meat-sauce-niku-miso/) but with slight modifications depending on if I want it to be more sweet or less. This time, I followed the recipe. For the meat, this time I used ground pork. It was delicious.

### Inside Out Eggroll Salad
The recipe I used for the inside out eggroll salad can be found [here]({{< relref "recipes/inside-out-eggroll" >}}).

### Bluberry, Raspberry, and Banana Fruit Salad
Not much of a recipe to this. Dice up a banana, toss the banana in lemon juice, add blueberries and raspberries.

### Pickles
This time I used a few sweet gherkins and a slice of sweet and hot bread and butter pickles.
