# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a Special 4th of July Thursday Edition bento! For today’s bento we have a pointed theme. Two kinds of yakitori on top of a bed of rice and a pair of grilled fruit kebabs as well. いただきます。

### Negima (Chicken thigh and green onion/negi)
I wish I had a great grilling setup to do these over charcoal. Would have been perfect. Instead, I used a small countertop convection oven with a burner on the top. Worked great. The recipe you are looking for can be found at Just One Cookbook's [Yakitori Recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/yakitori/).

### Tsukune (Chicken meatball)
I admit it, yakitori are delicious. All the chicken parts are good. Thigh? Yes. Heart or liver? Line them up. But one of my favourites just happens to be the humble tsukune. Learning how to make these was fun and, if I'm being honest, almost as delicious as at a yakitori joint. Try it yourself with Just One Cookbook's [Tsukune Recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tsukune/).

### Grilled Fruit
I had not thought of grilling fruit before today, but I wanted to stick with the theme. Get it? Stick....

Bad jokes aside, I didn't expect grilling fruit to change the flavours of them. I was wrong. It made them sweeter and sourer and just plain richer. I highly recommend you try this with your favourite fruits. I used pineapple, peaches, strawberries, and kiwi. They all were amazing. Melon will also work, but I don't like melon. They can be skewered and then grilled on a grill or, like I did, diced up and seared/grilled in a dry pan and then skewered. Enjoy.
