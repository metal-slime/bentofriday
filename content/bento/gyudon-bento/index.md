# Happy Bento Friday!

After a long hiatus, we’re back! Today’s bento is gyudon. Comes with a side of strawberries, broccoli stir fried in lao gan ma, and tamagoyaki. With munster cheese bunny and deli ham blossom accents. いただきます。

### Gyudon
The gyudon for this recipe is based off of the Yoshinoya style recipe at Just One Cookbook, [Gyudon](https://www.justonecookbook.com/yoshinoya-beef-bowl-gyudon/). I can't say I follow the recipe perfectly any longer but it is always my guide. A tip for those of us who do not have access to Japanese style thinly sliced meats, go to the freezer section and get the normal [Gary's Quick Steak](https://garysquicksteak.com/sirloin/). Open the package, throw away the seasoning mix, and go. You can thaw it beforehand for quicker cooking, but it works fine from frozen.

### Tamagoyaki
This was a pretty standard tamagoyaki. Take 6 or 7 eggs, mix/blend them up (I use an immersion blender), and add in a little sugar and a little dashi or instant dashi powder granuales if you have it. Using a tamagoyaki pan works great. For specific recipes and techniques, [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tamagoyaki-japanese-rolled-omelette/) has some great options for both.

### Lao Gan Ma Broccoli
This is a pretty easy side. I wrote up the recipe [here]({{< relref "recipes/lao-gan-ma-broccoli" >}}), but it barely needs one.
