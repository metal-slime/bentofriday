# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is tonkatsu. Tonkatsu on top of white rice. Comes with shredded cabbage with a light vinaigrette, tonkatsu sauce, and a yogurt parfait/sundae with homemade strawberry jam/sauce. いただきます。

### Tonkatsu
Tonkatsu is almost heavenly. Fried panko encrusted pork loin that has been lovingly beaten out to a thin slice. So tasty. It is customary to serve it with rice and shredded cabbage, so I did. Here is how I make it [Tonkatsu]({{< relref "recipes/tonkatsu" >}}).

### Shredded Cabbage
Shredded cabbage is a very simple, yet refreshing side dish. You can use a mandolin or similar device to slice it, but I typically take a head of cabbage, peel off the leaves, roll the leaf up, and slice thinly with a knife. Whatever method you use to do it, it will work fine. There is a chain in Japan called Tonkatsu Wako, they have an awesome dressing that is used with the cabbage. Sadly, I do not have it and have no idea how to replicate it. Instead, I lightly drizzled a strawberry vinaigrette over the cabbage in homage to Wako.

### Greek Yogurt and Strawberry Jam Sauce Parfait
What do you get when you take full fat greek yogurt and put a strawberry jam sauce over top of it? I would almost call it a sundae but parfait works out fine. Either way, it is delicious. My guidelines for making strawberry jam sauce can be found [here]({{< relref "recipes/strawberry-jam-sauce" >}}).

### Tonkatsu Sauce
Tonkatsu sauce is tonkatsu sauce. A savoury and sweet concoction from Japan. You can buy or make it, I prefer to buy Bulldog's brand.
