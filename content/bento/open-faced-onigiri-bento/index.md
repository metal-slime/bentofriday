# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a partial repeat of open face onigiri. One salmon mayo and four chicken mayo onigiri bento. Comes with a side of fresh diced salad (napa cabbage, bell peppers, broccoli florets, and a cherry tomato for most), and a cranberry, pineapple, mandarin orange fruit salad. いただきます。

### Open Faced Onigiri
What is an open faced onigiri? Well, have you heard of an open faced roast beef sandwich? Where the insides of the sandwich are served on top of bread instead of between slices? Same concept, but put the onigiri filling on top of a bed of [white rice]({{< relref "ingredients/white-rice" >}}).

Today there were two different toppings. One was salmon mayo, the other was chicken mayo. What is/are salmon and chicken mayo? Much like tuna mayo, they're just versions of/spins on tuna salad. Take a look at the general base recipe [here]({{< relref "recipes/mayos" >}})

### Fresh Napa Salad
The fresh napa salad doesn't really need its own recipe. Dice up some napa cabbage, chop up some sweet peppers, dice fresh broccoli florets into smaller pieces, and put it all in a mixing bowl. Toss the salad to mix it up. Add in some strawberry vinaigrette (homemade or storebought) and toss it a bit more. Garnish with a cherry tomato or two.

### Cranberry, Pineapple, and Mandarin Orange Fruit Salad
Get a can of whole cranberry sauce. Dump it into a mixing bowl. Add into it a can of pineapple chunks in juice. Drain a can of mandarin oranges and then toss them in. Mix until the cranberry sauce jell has fully dissolved.
