# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a barbecue bento. Smoked pulled pork comes with a fluffy yellow bun and barbecue sauce. It is accompanied by fresh blueberries, homemade coleslaw, and maple bacon baked beans. いただきます。

### Smoked Pulled Pork
I got a smoker years ago. I love using it, even if every attempt to smoke something becomes its own journey, that's part of the fun! While whitefish is my favourite smoked food, pork butt/shoulder is a close second. Here is how I do it [Smoked Pulled Pork]({{< relref "recipes/smoked-pulled-pork" >}}).

### Homemade Coleslaw
I am not a huge fan of coleslaw. Most of the time, I really don't like it. The wife does, so I've looked for a recipe that we would both like. I found it in following the outline from Serious Eat's [Coleslaw recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-cole-slaw). I did make it the easy way and used two bags of coleslaw mix instead of slicing my own. Worked out very well with the amount of dressing.

### Maple Bacon Baked Beans
I am also not a huge fan of baked beans. If they come from a can, I don't like them. I've made them from scratch in the past, but today, I didn't want to cook beans for hours. I used Busch's maple bacon baked beans. Everyone else seems to like them.
