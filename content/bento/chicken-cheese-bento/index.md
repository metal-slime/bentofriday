# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a chicken and cheese bento. Homemade macaroni and cheese, double fried karaage, caeser salad, and fresh raspberries. いただきます。

### Karaage
For karaage there are three things to remember. 1. Cut your chicken thigh into bite size pieces. 2. Marinate properly for no more than an hour. 3. Double fry for the perfect texture. Everything else can be found (and explained better than I can) in Just One Cookbook's [Karaage Recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/karaage/).

### Grandma's Mac and Cheese
When I was a kid, for my birthday, my Grandma always made me her mac and cheese. It isn't culinary brilliance. It isn't even the best ingredients, but it was my birthday treat and I still make it every now and then. The recipe can be found [here]({{< relref "recipes/grandmas-mac-and-cheese" >}}).

### Caesar Salad
Sometimes it makes sense to handcraft a salad. Other times it may make sense but it is easier and cheaper to buy a salad kit. For today's bento, Dole's Ultimate Caesar Salad mixes were on sale. I got two of those and used them per the instructions. It is a tasty salad kit.
