# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a Polish-ish themed bento. Traditional pork goulash over egg noodles. Comes with a side of apple bacon sauerkraut, sweet and dill gherkins, and a berry medley. いただきます。

### Traditional Pork Goulash
Who doesn't want a nice, slow cooked pork stew? Well, I suppose vegetarians, vegans, and some religious people. For the rest of us, it is quite tasty. The way it is cooked, the meat melts in your mouth. I do follow this [Traditional Pork Goulash Recipe](https://polishfoodies.com/authentic-polish-goulash-recipe/) when making this goulash. The one thing to pay particular attention to is, stir frequently. This can and will burn, don't let it.

### Apple Bacon Sauerkraut
Sauerkraut is a great thing. It is healthy and it has a great taste and texture. But, sometimes, it isn't enough. I want kraut but I want better kraut. That's when I make [Apple Bacon Sauerkraut]({{< relref "recipes/apple-bacon-kraut" >}}).

### Gherkins
The Polish people I know tell me pickles are important, especially gherkins. With that in mind, I included both sweet and dill mini-gherkins in this bento.

### Berry Pile
Pre-cut/arrange berry assortments were on sale at the store. I bought one and piled the berries up in each bento.
