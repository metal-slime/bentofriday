# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a pasta bake casserole bento. Spaghetti casserole, aka baked spaghetti, with pan roasted broccoli and a mix of raspberries and blackberries. いただきます。

### Spaghetti Casserole
Call it a casserole, hot dish, pasta bake, or whatever you want, but don't call it late for dinner. Spaghetti Casserole is a dish my family has made for years and years. It is a tasty and filling dish. You might look at today's bento and think that there isn't much food, but the pasta bake is at least as tall as a large piece of lasagna and definitely heavier. Here is my recipe [Spaghetti Casserole]({{< relref "recipes/spaghetti-casserole" >}}).

### Pan Seared Broccoli
Put some of your preferred cooking fat in a pan and melt it down (I used wagyu tallow today). Toss in frozen broccoli and cover. Let it steam a bit. Then season with garlic, salt, pepper, and MSG. Let some parts of it sear and you have a delicious and healthy side dish.

### Raspberries and Blackberries
Arrange your fruit in a manner that looks good to you. It doesn't have to be fancy.
