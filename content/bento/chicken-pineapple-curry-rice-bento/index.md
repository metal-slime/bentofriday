# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is chicken pineapple curry fried rice. Comes with two different types of egg rolls, pickles, and yogurt with a peach jam sauce. いただきます。

### Chicken Pineapple Curry Fried Rice
Since discovering curry, I've loved it. One of my favourite dishes from our local Chinese place when we lived in Chicago was their curry fried rice. A little spicy, very flavourful, and good colour. Today, I went with chicken and pineapple. The pineapple goes well with curry. Here is my base recipe for [Curry Fried Rice]({{< relref "recipes/curry-fried-rice" >}}).

### Pork Egg Rolls
I like egg rolls. I like egg rolls with fried rice. I got two different kinds of pork egg rolls from the grocery store and decided to use one of each.

### Yogurt with Peach Jam Sauce
The strawberry jam sauce topped yogurt went over very well a few weeks ago. With the heat of the rice, I decided something dairy would be good today. I repeated the [jam sauce]({{< relref "recipes/strawberry-jam-sauce" >}}) process with peaches for today. It is just as good and the embodiment of the essence of peach.

### Pickles
Sweet and dill gherkins to cleanse the pallet.
