# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a slider bento. Ham loaf (ground pork and ham mixed together) sliders with mayo, white american cheese, and grilled pineapple on hawaiian rolls . Comes with curry sweet potato fries, cheeseburger salad, and fresh peach slices. いただきます。

### Hawaiian Sliders
At the meat counter at Fareway, in the winter, they have a ground meat mix called ham loaf. For those not aware, it is a mix of ground pork and ground ham. In the midwest, it is often used around Easter to make an ... interesting ... meatloaf like dish. That is often not tasty. I got the idea to use it for burgers with cheese and pineapple. Most definitely delicious. Here is my recipe [Hawaiian Sliders]({{< relref "recipes/hawaiian-sliders" >}}).

### Curry Sweet Potato Fries
Slice up some sweet potato into wedges. Toss in some olive oil and some flavour and you have fries. [Curry Sweet Potato Fries]({{< relref "recipes/curry-sweet-potato-fries" >}})

### Cheeseburger Salad
I got this Dole salad mix kit on a whim because it said burger and burger is like a slider, right? It worked out surprisingly well. Thousand Island dressing and pickle chips (like french fried onions). Tastier than not.

### Sliced Peaches
Nothing fancy about sliced peaches. However, I've been trying to use peaches in a bento for weeks and they just haven't ripened up correctly. I love peaches.
