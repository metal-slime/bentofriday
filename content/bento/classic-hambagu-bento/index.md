# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a hambagu bento. Classic Japanese hambagu with sauce over white rice. Comes with three sides. A summery side salad of spinach, lettuce, strawberries, avocado and freshly boiled sweet corn tossed in olive oil and lemon juice. A fruit salad of fresh peaches, fresh pineapple, and fresh blueberries. And a dessert strawberry fluff salad. いただきます。

### Classic Hambagu
Classic Japanese Hambagu is very much like salsbury steak or mini meatloafs for the rest of the world. Ground beef and pork combined to make something delicious. The recipe can be found [here]({{< relref "recipes/classic-hambagu" >}}).

### Summer Corn and Avocado Salad
I asked the wife if she wanted a cooked side or a summer-y side salad. She went with summer and I threw this salad together. Definitely brings thoguhts of summer to me, see the recipe [here]({{< relref "recipes/summer-corn-avocado-salad" >}}).

### Fruit Salad
Today's fruit salad is another that doesn't need a recipe. Get some fresh fruit, cut it into slices or cubes, toss together, and serve. Super simple.

### Strawberry Fluff Dessert Salad
Fluff salads are an invention from the Midwest. What do you get when you mix flavored gelatin, frozen (thawed) fruit, and cool whip? You get awesome is what you get. There are a bunch of different ways to make these, but I make them like my grandma did and you can see how [here]({{< relref "recipes/fluff-salad" >}}).
