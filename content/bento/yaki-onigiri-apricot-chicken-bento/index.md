# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a yaki onigiri bento. Slightly seasoned rice formed into onigiri and grilled is accompanied by an apricot chicken and broccoli stir fry and some fresh pineapple. いただきます。

### Yaki Onigiri
I've tried making yaki onigiri a few times. I just can't get mine to look exactly like they do in the pictures but they still taste great. This time around I tried [Just One Cookbook's](https://www.justonecookbook.com/yaki-onigiri-grilled-rice-ball/) recipe. It worked out very tasty.

### Apricot Chicken
I like mixing apricot sauces with chicken or pork. This time around it was with chicken breast (as it was on sale). I use [this recipe](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2020/04/apricot-chicken/) as a guide but don't measure everything out exactly any longer. I do toss the broccoli in with the meat and sauce. You don't have to roast the broccoli but it is tasty if you do.

### Fresh Pineapple
Fresh cut pineapple doesn't need much in the way of explaining. Still delicious.
