# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is a Japanese dry curry bento. Dry curry on a bed of white rice. Comes with a side salad with a sesame dressing, a tomato pasta salad, and fresh red and green grapes. いただきます。

### Japanese Dry Curry
I love curry. I want everyone to love curry as much as I do. I was originally going to make this curry with a Japanese keema curry roux but I didn't want to use up all my roux just for this. Instead, I went to my usual source and found this [dry curry recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-dry-curry/). It was delicious. I omitted the green peppers and the raisins but everything else was pretty much her recipe. Japanese curry powder really does make a difference. For my own bento, I did make two basted eggs day of and put them on top of the curry. It was amazing.

### Sesame Side Salad
This week I went with another pre-packaged salad for the bento. It was Dole's Asian Sesame salad. It has a nice flavour profile that complimented the curry very well.

### Tomato Pasta Salad
I was a bit lazy this week and got another store salad for this. Mrs. Gerry's has a fun line of products. This was the Mrs. Gerry's tomatoe pasta side salad. It complimented everything else very well.
