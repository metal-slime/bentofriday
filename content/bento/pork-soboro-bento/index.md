# Happy Bento Friday!

Today’s bento is soboro don bento. Pork soboro and egg soboro on top of fluffy white rice. Comes with some roasted brussels sprouts and red and purple grapes. いただきます。

### Pork and Egg Soboro
I've made soboro out of many meats. I find that chicken, turkey, and pork are pretty much interchangeable, but beef (or similar) are a little different. When using the first three meats, I do one of these two recipes, [NHK](https://web.archive.org/web/20210619130246/http://www.nhk.or.jp:80/dwc/recipes/detail/239.html) and [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tori-soboro-donburi/) or a combination of them. Same goes for the egg soboro. Fluffy, sweet and savoury goodness.

### Roasted Brussels Sprouts
Roasted brussels sprouts are one of my favourite foods. I can eat them just about anytime. Frozen sprouts, larger ones cut into halves or quarters. Toss in olive oil. Roast at 375F then finish off at 425F for colour.

### Red and Purple Grapes
Seedless grapes looked really good at the store and tasted amazing.
